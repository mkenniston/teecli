# supported by TEECLI.  You only need to run this script once,
# manually (it does not auto-run), immediately after installing
# TEECLI.
# This script is just a hint to help you get started efficiently,
# and it is safe to ignore any tools that you don't need -- for
# example you can ignore the "dotnet" message if you aren't
# testing any C# code.
# Specific installation instructions for each tool are not included
# here because those can vary depending on which Linux distribution
# and version you are running.
